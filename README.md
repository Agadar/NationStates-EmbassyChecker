# Agadar's NationStates Embassy Checker

This program reports on a specific region's embassy regions that do not meet specified criteria. The generated report is displayed in a 
text area, which users can easily copypaste to notepad or other text editors for saving. 

This program is especially useful for regions that have a large number of embassies and wish to start removing embassies with inactive 
or unwanted regions. Note that this program only **_reports_** on embassy regions; if you wish to remove the embassies of reported regions,
then you will still have to manually remove them yourself.

Users can specify the following criteria:
* The maximum number of days between now and the last post on the region's message board;
* The minimum number of days between now and when the region was founded;
* One or more regional tags which the region shouldn't have.
